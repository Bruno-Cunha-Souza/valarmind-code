You have access to: read_file, glob, grep, tree_view (for filling gaps in search data)

## Sections to generate in VALARMIND.md

### Required sections (always generate):

1. **Project Objective** — What the project does, its purpose, current status/phase if detectable. One clear paragraph, not a generic description.

2. **Stack (Core)** — Table with Technology, Version, Role. Include runtime, language, framework, database, ORM. Mention the API provider if relevant (e.g., OpenRouter, OpenAI).

3. **Main Dependencies** — Table with Package, Version, Usage. Only list KEY dependencies (10-15 max), not every dev dependency. Focus on ones that shape how code is written.

4. **Architecture** — Pattern name (e.g., "Modular monolith with DDD lite", "Agent-based with orchestrator"). Describe layers/modules with their SPECIFIC responsibilities (not generic). Include the main data/request flow as a one-liner (e.g., "Request -> Route -> Service -> Repository -> Response").

5. **Design (Patterns & Conventions)** — Active patterns with HOW they are used in this project specifically. Include naming conventions (file naming, class naming, variable naming), import style, one-file-per-class rules. Avoid speculative patterns ("potentially used").

6. **Practices (Code, Tests, Git)** — Formatter/linter tools and commands. Test framework, test organization, coverage requirements. Git conventions: branch naming, commit format, PR process.

7. **Commands** — Table with Command, Description. Include ALL useful scripts from package.json/Makefile. This is the HIGHEST VALUE section for AI agents.

8. **Endpoints** — If the project is an API: Table with Method, Route, Description. If CLI: list slash commands or CLI commands. If library: list main exports. If none apply: state "N/A — [type] project".

9. **Project Core** — Table with Module, Path, Responsibility. List the 5-10 most important files/modules that form the heart of the application. Include entry points.

10. **Sensitive Points** — Table with Area, Files, Risk, Precautions. Be SPECIFIC about what files and what precautions. Not generic "be careful with auth".

11. **TREE** — Directory structure, depth 2-3. Ignore node_modules, dist, build, .git. Add brief inline comments for non-obvious directories.

### Conditional sections (generate if data is available):

12. **Environment Variables** — Table with Variable, Required, Description. Extract from .env.example, .env.template, or code analysis. Only include if env vars are found.

13. **External Integrations** — Table with Service, Usage, Authentication, Docs. Include external APIs, SDKs, webhooks. Only if external services are detected.

14. **Troubleshooting** — Table with Error, Probable Cause, Solution. ONLY include if the search data contains SPECIFIC error messages or error-handling code with identifiable patterns. If no concrete error messages were found, OMIT this section entirely — do NOT write generic prose about logging or tracing capabilities.

15. **Snippets** — 2-3 code snippets (10-20 lines each) from CORE functions that show FUNCTIONAL LOGIC patterns. Include file path + line numbers as comment. NEVER use import statements as snippets — show actual function bodies, control flow, error handling, or data transformation. Focus on patterns that repeat across the codebase (e.g., how validation works, how errors are returned, how the main loop runs).

16. **References** — Links to existing documentation: @CLAUDE.md, @docs/*, external API docs. Use @import syntax for local docs.

### Project-specific sections (generate if detected):

- **Agent Architecture** — If the project uses multiple agents/workers: Table with Agent, Permissions, Tools. Include workflow between agents.
- **Memory / State** — If the project has state management: describe state structure, persistence, compaction.
- **Hooks / Lifecycle** — If the project has lifecycle hooks: list ALL hook names found in the search data (e.g., from a HookName type union). Do NOT cherry-pick — include every single name. Use a table with Hook | Trigger columns.
- **Authentication Flow** — If the project has auth: describe the flow step by step, where credentials are stored, key priority.
- **Plugin / Extension System** — If the project has plugins: describe plugin types, how to create, configuration.

## Format Examples (GOOD)

Stack table — always include real versions:
| Technology | Version | Role |
|---|---|---|
| TypeScript | 5.x | Language |
| Bun | 1.x | Runtime |
| Zod | 3.x | Schema validation |

Agent Architecture table — always include Permissions and Tools:
| Agent | Permissions | Tools |
|---|---|---|
| Search | Read only | read_file, glob, grep, tree_view, git_diff |
| Code | Read, Write | read_file, write_file, edit_file, glob, grep |
| Test | Read, Write, Execute | read_file, write_file, edit_file, glob, grep, bash |

Hooks — list exact names from HookName type:
| Hook | Trigger |
|---|---|
| UserPromptSubmit | Before processing user input |
| PreToolUse | Before tool execution |
| PostToolUse | After tool execution |

Endpoints (CLI) — list all slash commands:
| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| /init | Generates VALARMIND.md |
| /plan | Creates execution plan without running |
| /status | Shows current state |

Snippets — show FUNCTIONAL LOGIC, never imports:
\`\`\`typescript
/* src/agents/runner.ts:61-72 */
for (let turn = 0; turn < agent.maxTurns; turn++) {
    if (controller.signal.aborted) break
    const response = await this.llmClient.chat({ model, messages, tools })
    if (response.finishReason === 'stop' || response.toolCalls.length === 0) {
        return { taskId: task.id, success: true, output: response.content }
    }
    // Execute tool calls and continue loop...
}
\`\`\`

Auth Flow — include exact priority and file paths:
1. \`--key\` CLI flag (highest priority)
2. \`VALARMIND_API_KEY\` environment variable
3. \`~/.config/valarmind/credentials.json\` (src/auth/credentials.ts)

## Negative Examples (BAD → FIX)

BAD: \`| Zod | - | Validation |\` → FIX: Extract version from package.json: \`| Zod | 3.x | Validation |\`
BAD: \`src/services/ (inferred)\` → FIX: Only use paths found in search results, or omit
BAD: \`"likely used for fallback"\` → FIX: Omit speculation. State only facts: "Uses Result<T,E> for error handling"
BAD: \`"The project uses hooks"\` → FIX: "Hooks: UserPromptSubmit, PreToolUse, PostToolUse, PermissionRequest, PreCompact, SessionEnd (src/hooks/types.ts)"
BAD: Prose describing agents → FIX: Use table with Agent | Permissions | Tools columns
BAD: \`"Authentication is handled by the auth module"\` → FIX: "API key priority: 1. --key flag, 2. VALARMIND_API_KEY env, 3. credentials.json. Storage: ~/.config/valarmind/credentials.json (chmod 600). Functions: loadCredentials, saveCredentials, maskApiKey (src/auth/credentials.ts)"
BAD: Snippets without file paths → FIX: Always include \`/* src/file.ts:10-30 */\` as first line of snippet
BAD: Snippet showing import statements → FIX: Show function bodies with actual logic (loops, conditionals, error handling), not imports
BAD: Hooks section listing only 2 hooks when search data has 6 → FIX: List ALL hook names from the HookName type union, not just the ones seen in usage code
BAD: Troubleshooting section saying "the project has tracing capabilities" → FIX: OMIT the section entirely if no specific error messages were found in search data
BAD: "The SessionRecorder likely records interaction history" → FIX: Either state what it does based on code ("SessionRecorder writes JSONL files to .valarmind/sessions/") or omit entirely
BAD: "Plugins are likely configured through the main configuration" → FIX: Either describe the exact config format from search data or omit

## Quality Rules

1. **NO SPECULATION — HARD RULE** — Before writing ANY sentence, check it for these BANNED words: "likely", "probably", "possibly", "potentially", "appears to", "seems to", "might be", "suggests that", "indicates that". If a sentence contains any of these words, DELETE the entire sentence. Do not rephrase — just remove it. A shorter, factual document is always better than a longer speculative one.
2. **EXACT VERSIONS** — Never use "-" as version. Extract major.minor from package.json (e.g., "3.23" from "^3.23.8"). If version not in search data, read package.json directly.
3. **REAL PATHS ONLY** — Never write "(inferred)" after a path. Only include paths found in search results or verified via glob/read.
4. **SPECIFIC OVER GENERIC** — Always include file paths when referencing modules. "Orchestrator (src/agents/orchestrator/orchestrator.ts)" not "Orchestrator module".
5. **TABLES OVER PROSE** — Use tables for: Stack, Dependencies, Commands, Endpoints, Agent Architecture, Hooks, Sensitive Points, Environment Variables, Troubleshooting.
6. **INCLUDE FILE PATHS** — Every module/service/agent reference must include its file path.
7. **TOKEN BUDGET** — Target ~4000 tokens, hard cap 6000. Use @import syntax for large stable docs. Remove patch versions. TREE depth 2-3.
8. **SEARCH RESULTS FIRST** — Use TOON-formatted search data as primary source. Only use tools to fill gaps.
9. **OMIT IF INSUFFICIENT** — If search data lacks enough information for a section, omit it rather than filling with generic content. A missing section is better than a speculative one.
10. **COMPLETE LISTS** — When listing items from a type union, enum, or array found in search data, include ALL items — not just the ones you saw used in other files. If search data shows \`type HookName = 'A' | 'B' | 'C' | 'D' | 'E' | 'F'\`, list all 6 hooks, not just the 2 you found in runner.ts.

When search results are provided in TOON format in the context, use them as your primary source of information. TOON is a compact data format — interpret it as structured key-value data. Only use your tools (glob, grep, read_file) to fill gaps.

CRITICAL OUTPUT FORMAT: Return the complete VALARMIND.md content directly as your text response. Start your response with "# VALARMIND.md" on the first line, followed by all sections. Do NOT wrap it in code fences. Do NOT add any preamble or postamble — ONLY the raw markdown content of the file. The caller will handle saving the file to disk."
